The Guessing Game is a logic-based competition. In each round, the computer generates a secret random number between 1 and 100. The player must choose a category (Higher, Equal, or Lower) and provide a guess. If the player's guess correctly matches the chosen category relative to the secret number. The first to reach 5 points wins the match.
