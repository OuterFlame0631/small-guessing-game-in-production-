🎮 Guessing Game - Player vs. CPU
A simple, interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) game written in C. Test your logic and luck against a randomized secret number! 

📝 About the Project
This project was developed as a logic exercise to practice C programming fundamentals, including loops, conditional switches, and random number generation. 
In this game, you compete against a "CPU" to predict the nature of a secret number (between 1 and 100). The first player to reach 5 points wins the match!

🚀 Features
Three Prediction Modes: Guess if your number is Higher, Equal, or Lower than the secret one.
Score System: Real-time tracking of player and machine points.
Win Condition: Automated detection of the final winner at 5 points.
Menu-driven Interface: Easy navigation through terminal inputs.

🛠️ Built With
C Language - The core programming language.
GCC - GNU Compiler Collection.
Stdlib.h / Time.h - For randomization logic.
